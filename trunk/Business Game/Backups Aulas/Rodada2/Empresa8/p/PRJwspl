Welcome to TOPSIM - Project Management!

  The newly installed software is ready for use, so the game can begin.
  The game parameters have been set and standard decisions have been 
  made for all companies in the game. These decisions are the same for 
  all companies and will be overwritten by the decisions made later 
  in the game.

  You receive an overview of the functions by clicking on the menu. 
  You will find explanations for the various menu functions in the 
  Help section.

  If you wish to have a practice run, please consult the manual, 
  pocket 4.

  In order to return to the starting situation please select the menu 
  command "New Simulation" in the menu "File". Confirm your selection 
  upon the system's prompt and simply select OK in the dialog box 
  called "Key Seminar Data". This process is also used to start a new 
  management game.

  If you have any questions please consult the manual and do not 
  hesitate to call us.
