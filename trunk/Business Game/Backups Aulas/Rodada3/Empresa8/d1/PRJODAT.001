At the beginning of the process, the basic concept of the layout is established. 
In the design process, the initial sketches and designs for the equipment are completed. 
Most importantly the calculations for the track's design are determined according to kinematic 
and kinetic principles.

The project manager's tasks include coordinating the overall design, detail 
specification and generating offers, selecting suppliers and subcontractors with the 
purchaser, and coordinating and monitoring the completion of the work in progress.


A steel suspension tower secured to the ground holds the roller coaster together and supports 
the highly dynamic loads. Appropriate manufacturing specifications are derived from mathematical 
computations. The roller coaster is to provide a thrilling and extreme experience, but will also 
conform to safety regulations. Safety is very important in the construction of amusement park 
equipment and accordingly the involvement of the Safety Standards Authority is required from the out
The layout of the track is determined by the roller coaster cars´ specifications and passenger loads
both of which are intricately linked to the structural steelwork. The technical designers´ objective
is to convert the roller coaster concept into a technical reality. Strength checks must be performed
security measures must be implemented, and the constructed pieces arranged and fitted together. 

It is important for the roller coaster cars to have a spacious design to allow for passenger 
seating and switching. The four wheel configurations are individually assembled instead of 
having two axles. Dividing the cars into two parts by means of a clutch ensures increased 
mobility in narrow curve segments.

Development of electronics for the track and all of the equipment. 
Designing of safety measures in conjunction with software development.



Subcontracting to Grader Ltd. which performed satisfactorily on the last project. 
The work is unproblematic and to date no problems have been experienced.



The engineering company G-force Ltd. will develop the accelerator. The G-force 
accelerator is an upgrade from the proven Launch-Coasters technology. The G-force 
accelerator will provide the roller coaster cars with an acceleration of 0 to 100km/h in 4.2
seconds.

The IT department can utilize previous experience and software modules from earlier 
models. Excellent documentation and error-free timely work is expected.



A novel and unique feature of the RocketStar is its Dolby-40-Crazy-Sound equipment 
provided by Hyperwave. Each car will have 22 4D loudspeakers with a frequency range of 
20 to 20.000 Hz. Along the tracks the steel supports will hold 200 loudspeakers. By 
synchronizing all of the stationary and onboard loudspeakers passengers will have a 4 
dimensional sound experience.
Excavation of the station's foundation, the power supply building, and the individual steel 
supports is required. Caterpillar Ltd. with its solid track record and considerable experience 
is assigned to this task.


Existing manufacturing plants must be adjusted to accommodate the new track design. 
This is accomplished through internal departments.



The assembly line for the roller coaster cars must be expanded as the cars are longer and 
wider than previous models. Internal departments have this responsibility. One potential 
problem is the availability of workers.


Monitoring, control, and safety systems must be programmed. Internal modules will be 
used, which will be updated soon.



The area of the recreational park to be used was previously a moor land and the soil is 
very soft, accordingly building the individual foundations for each support is complex and 
expensive. The base is a network of steel sections which distributes the loads evenly over 
a broad foundation.  Concrete Star Ltd. is to be the contractor.

In previous projects steel supports have been constructed by external companies. The 
current subcontractor was recently acquired by a large-scale enterprise. Up to now the 
work has always been satisfactorily completed and it is hoped that that this will continue.


The individual segments of the track are to be produced with varying curves and a unique 
rail surface which will guarantee a smooth ride. Production is to occur internally.



Passenger vehicles must be newly manufactured because of the new accelerator and 
drops in the track of more than 90°. Roller coaster car seatbelts are of the utmost 
importance.


The circuit boxes, cables, control switches and other electrical equipment are produced 
internally as individual components and their operability have already been largely tested.



Katax Ltd. is to manufacture the accelerator developed by the engineering company. 
Katax looks forward to this opportunity because it will be a challenge and a leap forward in
in their own technology.


The software module must be tested for operability and interface compatibility.




The company Soundtrack Ltd. has made the most attractive offer to produce the sound 
system. Although unknown to the project team they have made a good impression and 
have supplied good references. With the current development documents they should be 
able accomplish the task without any problems.

A loading station for the passengers and a building for the power supply must be built. 
The purchaser favors a local construction company called Woodbuilder Ltd.



In order to mount the steel supports special cranes are required. The company has five 
such cranes and management is confident that four cranes are available for the roller 
coaster project.


It is extremely important to properly document the software, as otherwise the client may 
reject the work. The documentation department bears this responsibility.



The assembly of track modules is a task for experienced specialists. The specialists are
assigned to this on a long-term basis and the project team has the full support of management. 



Assembling a new prototype is always an exciting affair. When the individual pieces are 
constructed properly and fit together with precision then assembly can proceed faster than 
anticipated.


The assembly of electrical components, modules, and systems is perceived to be problem-free.
However, the in-house Electronics Dept. anticipates potential problems with the integration of 
electrical modules with software modules.


Screwfix Ltd., a subcontractor, will complete the assembly of the accelerator. The  
accelerator equipment is pre-assembled by the subcontractor and the rest of the assembly 
occurs on site at the amusement park.


The software is installed in conjunction with the monitoring, control, and safety systems at 
the amusement park. The in-house IT department bears this responsibility.



The 200 loudspeakers are mounted above the track on the steel supports and special 
fastening devices were developed to this end. Assemblesound Ltd. Has provided the best 
references for this work package.


Internal cable lines must be connected to the power station and the transporter facility 
must be assembled and started. A subsidiary of a power plant, Electricity Ltd. has won the 
contract for this task.


This work package is responsible for the correct static-dynamic functioning of the roller 
coaster's mechanisms. The best in-house specialists will work on this test attempt.



Extensive tests must be performed on all control, safety, and monitoring systems. One 
ground breaking development is that the sound system is dependent on the position of the 
roller coaster car on the track. However the IT department feels overwhelmed with this 
responsibility.

Cars 2, 3, and 4 must be produced. The outcome of function test 1 is well documented 
and the requisite changes are made to the rest of the cars. Internal difficulties are not 
expected.


All mechanical components must be fined-tuned with a considerable emphasis on the cars 
must running extremely quietly. Coordinated and diligent work is necessary.



Problems which were identified in test B must be remedied. Experienced in-house 
specialists are available for this task and they request that scheduling take place as soon 
as practicable.


The equipment must be tested by 200 volunteers. The volunteers are paid well and 
accordingly participants from all desired target groups (12 to 80 years old) are available.



The final adjustments are made to the track and sound system. In-house specialists are 
required for this task.



Final changes are made to the body and underside of the roller coaster cars pursuant to 
official regulations, dynamic oscillations and load tests to 8G.



The electronic components are integral features of the control and safety systems and 
must be adapted to prevent climatic interference. This occurs in conjunction with the 
software module and precise value of the climate parameter is a pre-set value which is 
integral to the control systems.

The system documentation comprises the software documentation, all of the documents 
from the hardware development, hardware manufacturing and assembly of the equipment 
and the test logs from the equipment testing. This information is complied and given to the 
client.

The roller coaster will be surrounded by a fence, grass and flowers will adorn the site and 
the pathways to and from the station building will be paved. The subcontractor for this task 
is Greenflower Ltd.


The system documentation must be submitted to the Safety Standards Authority. 
Specialists from the company must be present when approval is given. If necessary, 
workers from the assigned engineering companies and subcontractors may be required to 
attend the preceding discussions.

This entails creating the training materials for briefing amusement park workers and the 
actual briefing and training. Experienced workers from sales and customer service bear 
this responsibility.


The client's employees are able to independently run the hypercoaster. The project 
concludes with a celebration to which all participants are invited which includes significant 
media coverage and fireworks.
