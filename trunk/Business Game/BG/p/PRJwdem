Welcome to the Demo-Version of
TOPSIM - Project Management

  With this Demo-Modus you are able to play the last phase of
  a special Demo-Scenario in order to get used to the system 
  and its functions.
  
  The menu item "reports" will provide you with the results of 
  previous periods as well as enable you to analyse the actual 
  project status. The optimisation for the last phase of the 
  project could be done within the network diagram, by selecting 
  the appropriate alternative for the left tasks, or through the 
  use of the menu item "Selection of Alternatives".
  After completing the optimisation of the project you can 
  simulate the last phase by releasing each week within the 
  network diagram perspective.

  Please orientate yourself on the functions of the menu by 
  clicking on the various menu items with the mouse of your PC. 
  A detailed description will be provided for you within th menu 
  item "Help"
  
  Good luck!
