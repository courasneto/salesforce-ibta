It appears that the manufacturing concept was never properly developed. The
flow of materials is only controlled through improvisation and production must be re-organized. 



The production process is optimized by an external consultant.




A little more time leads to lower costs and other advantages.

It runs well, but is more expensive than planned. 




Remove insignificant parts from the documentation.




A suggestion from the IT leader is to redevelop one of the existing modules. 




It functions as planned, but requires higher costs.




More time entails reduced costs.




Modernize old modules with new development tools. 




These types of discussions often take longer than planned.

There are constantly misunderstandings with the engineering company.




To do as all was initially intended. 




Establish a coordinator for the work of the engineering companies. 




The union does not agree. It requires at least 7 weeks for this procedure.

The old designs do not achieve the narrow radius required for the track layout. 




Internal crash-action advances new developments.




Convert the original concept purposefully.




The union was not informed and only approves the overtime. 




Ensure that the union approves the requested holiday for the company's employees.




Remain firm and force development through.




The development team cannot agree on a draft.




Required workers consult as advisors. 




Transfer development to an external engineering company.



















The evaluation of the documents was "worth gold".














The subcontractor misses the deadline, apologizes, and reduces the fee.














The technology is unsuitable and not yet fully developed.




Fall back on proven technology.




Transfer the task to a large-scale enterprise.

















































The weather has been very good and work progresses better than expected.












































Everything runs as planned. No concerns among the project team.














The development is not within one's grasp.




Subcontract immediately to the engineering company Acceleron.




Subcontract immediately to Speedstart Ltd.



















It runs well, but is more expensive than planned. 




Remove insignificant parts from the documentation.




A suggestion from the IT leader is to redevelop one of the existing modules. 




It functions as planned, but requires higher costs.




More time entails reduced costs.




Modernize old modules with new development tools. 




These types of discussions often take longer than planned. 
Advantage: Good suggestions often result.



Do without most suggestions.




Do without only some of the suggestions.



















The new technology causes problems, 
however one cannot cancel the contract with Hyperwave. 



Hyperwave offers another alternative "Multisound".




Hyperwave offers another alternative "Quadrotune".




The work time is somewhat longer than originally intended. 
The quality and technology however are better than expected.



Shortening time through overtime payment is possible.




No shortening of time, more time brings about better technology




The development takes longer than planned but the results are better as promised.




Supersound offers faster completion, but is somewhat more expensive.  




Technology is the priority.

To do as all was initially intended. 




Establish a coordinator for the work of the engineering companies. 




The union does not agree. It requires at least 7 weeks for this procedure.

It runs well, but is more expensive than planned. 




Remove insignificant parts from the documentation.




A suggestion from the IT leader is to redevelop one of the existing modules. 




It functions as planned, but requires higher costs.




More time entails reduced costs.




Modernize old modules with new development tools. 




These types of discussions often take longer than planned. 
Advantage: Good suggestions often result.



Do without most suggestions.




Do without only some of the suggestions.

To do as all was initially intended. 




Establish a coordinator for the work of the engineering companies. 




The union does not agree. It requires at least 7 weeks for this procedure.

The union was not informed and only approves the overtime. 




Ensure that the union approves the requested holiday for the company's employees.




Remain firm and force development through.

The subcontractor misses the deadline, apologizes, and reduces the fee.














The technology is unsuitable and not yet fully developed.




Fall back on proven technology.




Transfer the task to a large-scale enterprise.

Everything runs as planned. No concerns among the project team.














The development is not within one's grasp.




Subcontract immediately to the engineering company Acceleron.




Subcontract immediately to Speedstart Ltd.



















It runs well, but is more expensive than planned. 




Remove insignificant parts from the documentation.




A suggestion from the IT leader is to redevelop one of the existing modules. 




It functions as planned, but requires higher costs.




More time entails reduced costs.




Modernize old modules with new development tools. 




These types of discussions often take longer than planned. 
Advantage: Good suggestions often result.



Do without most suggestions.




Do without only some of the suggestions.

The work time is somewhat longer than originally intended. 
The quality and technology however are better than expected.



Shortening time through overtime payment is possible.




No shortening of time, more time brings about better technology




The development takes longer than planned but the results are better as promised.




Supersound offers faster completion, but is somewhat more expensive.
